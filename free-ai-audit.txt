Futurion Solutions
Compliance-First AI Audit Framework

Dental Clinics (Spain / EU)

This audit is designed to be:

Repeatable

Sellable

Defensible under GDPR scrutiny

Convertible into paid implementation

You should be able to run it in 5–7 business days.

AUDIT GOAL (Internal)

Identify where AI automation is safe, where it is dangerous, and where compliance controls are missing, then convert findings into a fixed-scope implementation proposal.

This is not a tech audit.
It is a risk + process audit with AI feasibility overlay.

AUDIT STRUCTURE (5 BLOCKS)
Block 1 — Clinic Profile & Risk Context (Day 1)

Objective:
Understand what kind of risk profile this clinic actually has.

Inputs (Interview + Checklist)

Clinic size (staff, chairs)

Patient volume (monthly)

Digital maturity (paper / mixed / digital)

Existing tools (practice management, email, WhatsApp, cloud storage)

Any past inspections, complaints, or GDPR incidents

Outputs

Clinic Risk Tier: Low / Medium / High

Automation Readiness: Low / Medium / High

🔒 Compliance Lens

Identify if clinic qualifies as high-risk data processor

Flag special categories of data (health, minors)

Block 2 — Data Mapping & Classification (Core GDPR Block)

Objective:
Map where patient data exists and moves today.

You Map (No exceptions)

Patient intake

Appointments

Treatment records

Imaging / lab data

Billing & insurance

Communications (email, SMS, WhatsApp)

Storage locations (local PC, server, cloud, third parties)

Data Classification

For each data flow:

Personal data?

Special category (health)?

Who has access?

Where is it stored?

Is it exported outside EU?

Outputs

Data Flow Map

Data Risk Register

Immediate red flags (e.g. WhatsApp usage, Google Drive misuse)

⚠️ This block alone builds massive trust.

Block 3 — Process Bottleneck & Automation Identification

Objective:
Find where time is wasted and where automation is tempting but risky.

You Analyze

Admin-heavy workflows:

Appointment handling

Patient follow-ups

Billing & insurance

Reporting

Internal documentation

For Each Workflow

You score:

Manual effort (Low–High)

Error risk

Data sensitivity

Automation potential

Compliance exposure

Outputs

Workflow Automation Matrix

Shortlist of Safe Automation Candidates

Explicit list of “Do NOT automate” processes

This protects you legally later.

Block 4 — AI Risk & Architecture Assessment (Your Differentiator)

Objective:
Determine how AI could be used safely, or not at all.

You Evaluate

For each candidate process:

Can AI be used without patient data?

Can data be anonymized?

Is on-prem or hybrid required?

Is cloud AI acceptable under GDPR?

Architecture Decision Tree

❌ Cloud AI (default): usually rejected

⚠️ Hybrid AI: conditional

✅ On-prem AI: preferred

Outputs

AI Usage Risk Rating

Approved Architecture Recommendation

Compliance justification (GDPR Articles referenced)

This is where generic AI agencies fail.

Block 5 — Compliance Gap & Action Plan (Conversion Engine)

Objective:
Turn findings into paid work, cleanly.

You Identify Gaps

Missing documentation

Unsafe data handling

Lack of auditability

No AI governance

No vendor risk controls

Deliverables

Executive Risk Summary (2 pages)

Compliance Gap List

Approved Automation Plan

Implementation Roadmap

Phase 1: Fix risks

Phase 2: Implement safe automation

Phase 3: Ongoing monitoring

This feeds directly into:

“Here’s what we recommend implementing, safely, and here’s the fixed price.”

FINAL AUDIT OUTPUTS (Client-Facing)

You always deliver:

AI & Compliance Risk Score

Data Flow Diagram

Automation Feasibility Matrix

“Safe / Unsafe / Conditional” AI Use List

Implementation Proposal (separate document)

This makes the audit non-optional to act on.

TIME & EFFORT (Reality Check)

Your time per audit: 6–8 hours

Client time: 2–3 short interviews

Delivery window: 5–7 days

Conversion rate target: 40–60%

WHAT I DO NOT NEED FROM YOU (Good News)

❌ No extra market data
❌ No external legal skill
❌ No new tools
❌ No certifications to start

Your existing GDPR + infra background is enough.

OPTIONAL (Nice-to-Have Later)

Only if you want to upgrade later:

Spanish DPA (AEPD) enforcement examples

Standard GDPR article mapping template

Lightweight DPIA template

Industry-specific consent language

None are blockers.

Coach Mode — Important Warning

If you skip Block 2 (Data Mapping) or Block 4 (AI Risk):

You become a generic AI consultant

You absorb compliance liability

You lose your moat

This framework is your defense and your leverage.


CHECKLIST + INTERVIEW SCRIPT

Below is a ready-to-use checklist + interview script designed so that:

you can run the audit consistently,

a future consultant could run it,

and every answer maps directly to risk, scope, and revenue.

No extra skills or info required.

Futurion Solutions
AI & Compliance Audit
Checklist + Interview Script (Dental Clinics)

Format: guided conversation + live checklist
Duration: 60–75 minutes total (can be split)
Tone: calm, non-technical, risk-aware

SECTION 0 — Opening Script (Read This Verbatim)

“This audit is not about selling you AI tools.
It’s about understanding where automation could help your clinic without creating GDPR or patient-data risk.

We’ll ask about processes and data handling. At the end, you’ll receive a clear report showing:

what’s safe to automate,

what isn’t,

and what needs to be fixed first.”

Pause. Get verbal consent to proceed.

SECTION 1 — Clinic Profile & Context
Questions (Ask in Order)

How many staff work in the clinic?

How many dental chairs?

Approximate patients per month?

Do you operate multiple locations?

Who handles admin work today? (roles, not names)

Checklist (You Fill)

☐ Solo / small / medium clinic

☐ High patient volume

☐ Owner involved in operations

☐ Admin overload evident

Internal Note:
Clinics where the owner still handles admin are high-conversion.

SECTION 2 — Digital Tools & Systems Inventory
Questions

What system do you use for:

Appointments?

Patient records?

Billing / insurance?

Do staff use:

Personal email?

WhatsApp with patients?

Where are files stored?

Local PC?

Local server?

Cloud (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.)

Checklist

☐ Practice management software

☐ Cloud storage used

☐ WhatsApp with patients ⚠️

☐ Personal devices used ⚠️

Red Flags to Mark

Patient data in messaging apps

Shared passwords

No access control

SECTION 3 — Data Handling & GDPR Reality Check
Questions (Slow Down Here)

Who can access patient data today?

Do you know where patient data is stored physically?

Has the clinic ever had:

GDPR inspection?

Patient complaint?

Do you have:

Written data processing procedures?

Vendor agreements (DPA)?

Checklist

☐ Access controls defined

☐ Data storage known

☐ GDPR documentation exists

☐ Vendor DPAs in place

Say This If Gaps Exist:

“This is very common. Most clinics are in the same situation.”

Never shame. You are the safe person.

SECTION 4 — Process Pain & Time Drain
Questions

What tasks take the most time each week?

Where do errors happen most often?

What admin tasks frustrate staff the most?

Are there tasks you wish were automated but don’t trust tools?

Checklist

☐ Scheduling pain

☐ Follow-ups manual

☐ Billing admin heavy

☐ Reporting manual

Internal Scoring

Manual effort: Low / Medium / High

Data sensitivity: Low / Medium / High

This feeds your Automation Matrix.

SECTION 5 — AI Awareness & Risk Perception
Questions

Have you experimented with AI tools?

What concerns you most about AI?

Data privacy?

Accuracy?

Regulations?

Would you use AI if data never left your clinic?

Checklist

☐ AI curious

☐ AI fearful

☐ AI misunderstood

☐ Compliance concerns dominant

This is your opening.

SECTION 6 — Architecture & Safety Validation (You Lead)

You do not ask — you explain and validate.

Say:

“There are three ways AI can be used in clinics:
cloud, hybrid, or fully on-prem.
Most clinics should never use cloud AI with patient data.”

Then ask:

Would keeping data inside the clinic be important to you?

Would you accept AI if it were auditable and documented?

Checklist

☐ On-prem required

☐ Hybrid acceptable

☐ Cloud rejected

SECTION 7 — Closing Script (Conversion Setup)

Read this slowly:

“Based on what you shared, there are:

some areas where automation could safely help,

some areas that should never be automated,

and a few compliance gaps that expose risk.

We’ll document everything and send you:

a risk overview,

a list of safe automation opportunities,

and a clear recommendation on what to do next.”
