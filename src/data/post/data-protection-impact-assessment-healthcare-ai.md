## What Is a DPIA?

A [Data Protection Impact Assessment](https://www.edps.europa.eu/data-protection-impact-assessment-dpia_en), commonly known as a DPIA, is a structured process that organisations must carry out before implementing any processing activity that is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals. It is not merely a bureaucratic checkbox — it is a disciplined mechanism that forces controllers to think carefully about what data they are handling, why they are handling it, what could go wrong, and how those risks can be reduced or eliminated before harm occurs.

The DPIA process is grounded in the principle of data protection by design. Rather than addressing privacy concerns after a system is already running, it requires organisations to build privacy safeguards into the architecture of their processing operations from the very beginning. In practical terms, this means that a DPIA is not something you do once a project is live — it is something you complete before you deploy.

At its core, a DPIA must contain four essential elements: a systematic description of the processing operations and their purposes; an assessment of whether those operations are necessary and proportionate to the goals pursued; an evaluation of the risks to data subjects; and a description of the measures taken to address those risks, including technical and organisational safeguards.

## When Is a DPIA Required?

The obligation to carry out a DPIA is triggered by the nature of the processing, not by the size of the organisation. Three situations make a DPIA mandatory.

The first is when a system performs a systematic and extensive evaluation of personal aspects of individuals based on automated processing — including profiling — and the outputs of that evaluation produce legal effects or similarly significant effects on those individuals. The second is when processing involves [special categories of data, such as health data](/ai-agents-healthcare-gdpr-risks/), on a large scale. The third is when there is systematic monitoring of a publicly accessible area on a large scale.

In the healthcare context, these triggers are not hypothetical edge cases. They describe the everyday reality of modern clinical AI. Health data is explicitly a special category of data, warranting the highest level of protection. Any AI system that analyses patient information to support or inform clinical decisions is performing automated evaluation of personal aspects. And any system that continuously monitors patients — whether in hospital or remotely — is engaging in systematic monitoring. For this reason, AI deployment in healthcare will almost always trigger the obligation to conduct a DPIA, regardless of whether the deploying organisation is a large hospital network or a small private clinic.

## Why DPIA Matters Specifically in Healthcare

Healthcare is arguably the domain where data protection failures carry the most severe human consequences. A breach of financial data is damaging. A breach of health data is potentially devastating — it can affect a person's employment, insurance, relationships, and psychological wellbeing in ways that are difficult or impossible to reverse.

AI amplifies these stakes considerably. When an algorithm influences whether a patient receives a particular diagnosis, treatment pathway, or level of urgency, errors in that algorithm are not merely technical failures — they are clinical events with real human consequences. Bias embedded in training data can lead to systematic discrimination against particular patient groups. Opaque model outputs can undermine the ability of clinicians to exercise meaningful oversight. Function creep — the gradual repurposing of data collected for care towards commercial, insurance, or research ends — becomes harder to detect and control once data flows are automated.

The DPIA framework addresses these risks directly. By requiring organisations to document what data is processed, justify why it is necessary, assess what could go wrong, and demonstrate what protections are in place, the DPIA creates accountability. It turns vague intentions about data protection into verifiable commitments. And crucially, if after completing the DPIA an organisation cannot demonstrate that residual risks are adequately mitigated, it is required to consult with the supervisory authority before proceeding — a safeguard that places an external check on the deployment of potentially harmful systems.

## How to Conduct a DPIA: The Seven Key Steps

Carrying out a DPIA is not a single act — it is a sequential process that requires input from multiple stakeholders and must be revisited whenever circumstances change. The following seven steps provide a practical roadmap for healthcare organisations deploying AI.

### Step 1 — Describe the processing

The starting point is a thorough, honest description of the processing operation. This means documenting what personal data is involved, the purpose for which it is being processed, the scope of the processing, and the broader organisational and technical context in which it takes place. For AI systems, this step must go beyond surface-level descriptions and capture the actual data flows — including where data originates, how it is transformed by the model, and where outputs are sent. Vague descriptions at this stage will undermine every subsequent step.

### Step 2 — Assess necessity and proportionality

Once the processing is fully described, the organisation must ask a hard question: is this processing actually necessary to achieve the stated purpose, and is it proportionate to that purpose? In healthcare AI, this means scrutinising whether the model needs all the data it is given, whether a less privacy-invasive approach could achieve the same clinical goal, and whether the benefits to patients genuinely justify the privacy costs. This step is where data minimisation principles are applied in practice.

### Step 3 — Identify the risks

This is the analytical core of the DPIA. The organisation must systematically identify threats to the rights and freedoms of the individuals whose data is being processed. In the healthcare context this includes risks such as diagnostic errors caused by model bias, unauthorised access to sensitive health records, re-identification of pseudonymised data, function creep towards insurance or commercial uses, and the erosion of patient autonomy through [opaque automated decision-making](/consultant-or-decision-maker-ai-clinical-accountability/). Risks should be assessed both in terms of their likelihood and the severity of potential harm.

### Step 4 — Identify controls

For each risk identified in Step 3, the organisation must document the technical and organisational measures it will put in place to mitigate that risk. Technical controls might include encryption, access controls, pseudonymisation, audit logging, and model explainability mechanisms. Organisational controls include staff training, clear [data governance policies](/gdpr-compliance-small-healthcare-providers-guide/), human oversight requirements for AI outputs, and defined procedures for responding to incidents. The controls must be specific and verifiable — not general assurances of good intent.

### Step 5 — Consult stakeholders

A DPIA conducted in isolation is inherently limited. This step requires bringing in the organisation's Data Protection Officer, IT and security teams, legal counsel, and — critically — representatives of the affected individuals, meaning patients or their advocates where feasible. In a clinical setting, involving frontline clinical staff is also essential, as they are best placed to identify practical risks in how AI outputs will actually be used and interpreted. Diverse perspectives at this stage significantly improve the quality of the risk assessment.

### Step 6 — Sign off

Once the assessment is complete and stakeholders have contributed, the DPIA must receive formal approval from the controller and, where applicable, the Data Protection Officer. This sign-off is not a formality — it represents an accountable commitment by the organisation that it has carried out the assessment in good faith and that the measures documented are genuinely in place. If the DPO disagrees with the controller's conclusions, that disagreement must be documented. If residual risks cannot be adequately mitigated, the matter must be escalated to the supervisory authority through a prior consultation before processing begins.

### Step 7 — Review and update

A DPIA is a living document, not a one-time exercise. The organisation is required to revisit it whenever the risk profile of the processing changes — for example, when an AI model is retrained, when new data sources are integrated, when the system is deployed at greater scale, or when new vulnerabilities are identified. In fast-moving clinical AI environments, this obligation to review is not a distant formality; it is a routine part of responsible system governance.

## DPIA in Practice: Seven Healthcare Automation Scenarios

### 1. Appointment Management

AI-driven appointment systems process patient identifiers, contact data, medical history flags, and scheduling preferences to automate booking, cancellation, and reminders. While this may appear administrative, the automated prioritisation of appointments — for example, routing patients with certain symptom profiles to earlier slots — constitutes automated evaluation of personal aspects with potentially significant effects. A DPIA must document how prioritisation logic works, what data feeds it, and how errors or unfair outcomes are detected and corrected. Access controls, data minimisation, and audit trails are baseline safeguards required here.

### 2. Patient Intake and Documentation

Automated intake systems collect structured and unstructured health data — symptoms, medical history, allergies, current medications — often before a patient has seen a clinician. When AI is used to pre-process or categorise this information, it is performing automated evaluation of special category data. The DPIA must address the purposes of that categorisation, whether the data collected is strictly necessary, how long it is retained, and what happens if the pre-processing produces an incorrect or misleading clinical picture. Consent mechanisms and the right to human review of automated outputs are essential considerations.

### 3. Internal Communication and Coordination

AI tools that route clinical messages, flag urgent cases, or summarise patient information for handover between professionals are processing health data in ways that directly affect care continuity. The risk profile here centres on confidentiality — ensuring that sensitive information reaches only the intended recipients — and on the reliability of automated summaries, which may omit clinically relevant detail. The DPIA must assess the consequences of communication failures, the robustness of access controls, and whether staff are trained to critically evaluate AI-generated summaries rather than accepting them uncritically.

### 4. Billing, Insurance, and Administration

Administrative AI that automates billing, insurance claims, or coding based on clinical data sits at the intersection of health information and financial decision-making. The risks are significant: incorrect coding can lead to denied claims, incorrect charges, or — in jurisdictions where insurers have access to claims data — downstream effects on a patient's insurability. The DPIA must examine [data flows to third-party insurers](/gdpr-subprocessor-management-eu-healthcare/), the legal basis for each category of sharing, and the safeguards preventing health data from being used for purposes beyond the original billing intent.

### 5. Patient Communication and Follow-up

Automated systems that send post-consultation instructions, medication reminders, or follow-up questionnaires are processing health data in patient-facing contexts. The sensitivity here is high: a message about a test result or medication sent to the wrong person, or intercepted in transit, can cause serious harm. The DPIA must address channel security, identity verification before sensitive information is transmitted, opt-out mechanisms, and the handling of responses — particularly if AI is used to interpret patient replies and trigger further actions without human review.

### 6. Foreign Language Patients and Real-Time Communication

AI translation and interpretation tools used in clinical encounters process some of the most sensitive data imaginable — real-time conversations between patients and clinicians about symptoms, diagnoses, and treatment options. The risks include translation errors with clinical consequences, data retention by third-party translation service providers, and the chilling effect on patient disclosure if individuals are uncertain who has access to their translated communications. The DPIA must scrutinise the data processing terms of any third-party provider, assess whether data is retained or used to train models, and ensure patients are informed that AI-assisted translation is being used.

### 7. Transcription of Doctor-Patient Conversations and ICD-10-ES Coding

This scenario represents one of the highest-risk applications of AI in clinical settings. Automated transcription of medical consultations combined with AI-driven diagnostic coding processes the full content of confidential clinical encounters and translates them into structured codes that then flow into medical records, billing systems, and potentially research databases. The DPIA here must be particularly rigorous. It must address the legal basis for recording consultations, explicit patient consent, the accuracy of both transcription and coding, the consequences of coding errors for treatment and billing, data retention policies for audio recordings, and the technical measures preventing unauthorised access to raw transcripts. Human review of AI-generated codes before they are committed to the medical record is not optional — it is a necessary safeguard to ensure that automated outputs do not silently propagate errors across the patient's entire clinical history.

## Conclusion

The DPIA is not a burden imposed on healthcare organisations — it is a tool that helps them deploy AI responsibly. In a domain where data errors can translate directly into harm, and where the volume and sensitivity of personal data processed is uniquely high, the structured discipline of the DPIA framework is one of the most practical instruments available to ensure that automation serves patients rather than exposing them to new forms of risk. The seven-step process — from describing the processing through to ongoing review — provides a clear and actionable structure that any organisation, regardless of size, can follow. Those that approach the DPIA seriously, as a genuine exercise in risk identification and mitigation rather than a compliance formality, will be better positioned to deploy AI that is not only legally compliant, but clinically trustworthy.
