        title: 'Why is the audit free?',
        description:
          'The audit builds trust and demonstrates our expertise. When practices see the depth of analysis, many choose to proceed with implementation. It\'s our way of proving value before asking for a commitment. About 40-60% of audited clinics proceed.',
      },
      {
        title: 'How do you determine implementation pricing?',
        description:
          'Pricing is based on the audit findings — number of workflows to automate, complexity, and compliance requirements. We provide a fixed-price proposal after the audit so there are no surprises. Quick wins start at €1,500, comprehensive packages at €5,000.',
      },
      {
        title: 'Is the monthly support plan required?',
        description:
          'No. Monthly support is optional but recommended. Regulations change, automations need tuning, and new opportunities emerge. The support plan ensures your automations stay compliant and optimized over time.',
      },
      {
        title: 'What payment methods do you accept?',
        description:
          'We accept bank transfers and major payment methods common in Spain and the EU. Payment terms are discussed during the proposal phase — typically 50% upfront and 50% on delivery for implementation projects.',
      },
      {
        title: 'Can we start small and expand later?',
        description:
          'Absolutely. That\'s our recommended approach. Start with the free audit, implement 1-2 quick wins, see the results, and then decide if a comprehensive package makes sense. No pressure to commit to everything upfront.',
      },

        title: 'What does MedCore Private AI cost?',

          'MedCore Private AI is priced per project based on infrastructure scope, model requirements, and organization size. Typical deployments range from \u20AC25,000 to \u20AC150,000+, with monthly support plans available. This includes hardware specification and procurement, software deployment, model customization, compliance documentation, and training. Contact us for a detailed assessment and quote.',
